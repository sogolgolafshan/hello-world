Instruction

Hi Humans,
Today is my 7th day of quarantine. From day 1st, I was thinking of making the most out of all these valuable freetimes that I would have and here I am. I am worried about what's going on in the world, but excited to start learning this course as well!
I made this change bc I'm learning how to use this software.
